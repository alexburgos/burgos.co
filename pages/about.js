				I'm Alex. I'm a web developer, photographer, and social activist from
				Puerto Rico residing in Brooklyn. I'm currently building user features
				and tools for Food52. On my spare time I collaborate with other
				activists, developers, and designers on projects that address
				socio-political issues. Catch me at a brewery with my dog, taking photos
				around the city and the world, or you can send me an email.
